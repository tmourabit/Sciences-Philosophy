What is the fundamental, central purpose and meaning of Islam for humanity?
The fundamental and central purpose of Islam revolves around the human being (الإنسان) and achieving justice and freedom on Earth.
The core idea is not the simple performance of rituals, waiting for the Mahdi (the saver), or even establishing a purely utopian world. Instead, the central purpose is understood through several interconnected concepts:
1. The Centrality of the Human Being and Justice
•	The central idea in Islam is the human being.
•	The goal is for the individual to traverse the path of life soundly (سليم) by adjusting internal behavior through supreme oversight and self-motivation. This includes controlling arrogance, impulses, and the dominance of personal desires.
•	God (Allah) does not seek a religious government ruling in His name; rather, God desires justice on Earth (العدل على الارض).
•	When justice is present, goodness is capable of prevailing.
•	The prophets struggled for this justice, which grants people the freedom to choose and test their will. True freedom is essential for this choice, free from pressure, temptation, temptation, force, or enticement.
2. Reform, Salvation, and Liberation
•	The purpose of the prophets was not to defend God or bring divine punishment upon non-believers, but to rescue people who were harming themselves and whose systems were corrupt.
•	The overarching aim is the reform of humanity (صلاح الانسانية), starting with the reform of the individual (صلاح الانسان).
•	This is achieved by setting the human compass (ضبط بوصلة الانسان) by the Creator, which leads to the betterment of the person in this world and the hereafter, based on their understanding of God's centrality in the equation.
•	True salvation involves liberation from three forms of human corruption: financial exploitation (like Qarun), political tyranny (like Pharaoh), and religious abuse (like Bal'am). It also requires liberation from the bondage of one's own desires and reckless inclinations.
3. The Role of the Believer and Unique Worship
•	The highest form of value in worship is serving a God you do not see and obeying a Lord whose existence you feel, without any direct connection. This unique form of faith—a guaranteed, unseen conviction (يقين غيبي)—is what distinguishes human worship.
•	The human being achieves a unique form of worship that realizes the meaning of God's names and attributes; for example, God loves human weakness because He is the Hearer (سميع), loves answering prayers because He is the Responder (مجيب), and loves to show mercy because He is the Merciful (الرحمن).
•	A Muslim is required to live as a noble, honorable human being (إنسان شريف محترم), who neither loves nor accepts oppression, arrogance, tyranny, or the exploitation of others. They must reject these evils with their hand, tongue, and heart, acting according to logic, reason, and custom.
•	The core message to the individual is: if you wish to be a Muslim, you must first be a human being. Islam is then capable of making you noble, honorable, and righteous.
Ultimately, the central idea of Islam is that the individual should become a strong, supportive force for truth, actively rejecting evil. The conflict is seen as a test where the most profound value of worship is attained through belief in the unseen. This belief should lead to the realization that an oppressive or exploitative God would not have sent a messenger to rescue and free the oppressed.
What makes the human unique?
The human being (الإنسان) is unique because God (Allah) honored, created, loved, raised, and distinguished humanity from all other creatures.
This distinction is fundamentally rooted in the unique type of worship that the human being offers to the Creator.
Key aspects that make humanity unique in this context include:
•	Free Will and Choice Unlike angels (الملائكة), who are described as a category of being that does not have the option of will (ما عندوش أوبشن إرادة) and cannot disobey God, the human being possesses the capacity for choice.
•	Unseen Conviction (Yaqin Ghaibi) The profound value of human worship is achieved by serving a God they do not see and obeying a Lord whose existence they feel, without any direct connection. This faith is based on a guaranteed, unseen conviction (يقين غيبي) that is not available to the angels. This life is considered a test/laboratory (المختبر) where the greatest value in worship is realized through this belief in the unseen.
•	Realizing Divine Attributes Human worship is described as a singular/unique devotion (عبادة فريدة) that realizes the meaning of God's names and attributes. For example, God loves human weakness because He is the Hearer (سميع), loves answering prayers because He is the Responder (مجيب), and loves to show mercy because He is the Merciful (رحمن).
•	Internal Moral Regulation The fundamental idea in Islam revolves around the human being navigating the path of life soundly by adjusting internal behavior through supreme oversight and self-motivation. This includes the unique human requirement to control arrogance, impulses, and the dominance of personal desires.
